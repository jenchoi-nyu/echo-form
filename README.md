# echo-form
Echo + Form is an experimental project that explores the intersection of technology, emotions, and traditional craft. By translating personal voice data—such as pitch, volume, and cadence—into physical ceramic vases, it aims to create personalized, tangible objects that capture both individual and collective emotional experiences
